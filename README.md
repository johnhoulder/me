## What is this?
This is a brief overview of me, how I work, my history, etc. You can use it to quickly learn a bit about me or just if you're interested in what I do. You can also get in touch with me via the methods at the bottom of this page.

## A Bit About Me

I live in Maltby, Rotherham. I have a pet German Shepherd, aptly named Jerry Lee (If you've seen K9, you'll understand).

I've lived in Maltby my whole life and know all the little hidden spots to escape to as well as a fair bit of lost history from my childhood days.

I'm also a software engineer with roughly 10 years of experience under my belt from starting extremely early with basic HTML websites and working my way from there to software development, API development and eventually building full backends for products using a range of languages.

## Job Roadmap
- Web Developer (Roy & Co / Damage. - Doncaster/Retford)
- Software Engineer (SBG - Sheffield)

## My Values
My main values are honesty and a positive attitude. If I don't agree with something, I'll make that point but I'll try to offer some constructive criticism where I can. I don't appreciate criticism that comes across as purely negative with no tips on how I could improve where it's avoidable and I wouldn't dream of doing that to someone else!

With positive attitudes, I like to see people happy even if they're met with a seemingly unsolvable problem. This also carries the whole "problem solver" trait of people to some extent, even if the solution is to ask someone else to help out.

## Communication
For reasons that I won't cover here, I prefer to talk to people over Slack but never feel like you can't approach me and talk to me face to face if you find it easier for yourself or if it would be quicker to have a quick face to face chat!

If you need to arrange a meeting with me, the best way is to send me a calendar invite and I'll let you know if I can attend. Otherwise, the chances are, I'll forget you invited me somewhere and end up letting you down!

## A bit about this README in general
This section isn't actually part of this README but I wanted to just cover what this is briefly. This is based on the Manager Readme (https://managerreadme.com/) that was brought to my attention recently. Although I'm not currently a manager, it seemed like a good idea to do one of these in a similar format to give people an idea about myself and a bit of backstory. If my thinking is correct, it'll help people get a bit more information on me, understand certain things I say and understand why I am how I am. If you want to do one of these yourself, find the template in TEMPLATE.md or fork this repo and change the text I added.

I'd be greatful if you attributed me as the original author of the template but I wouldn't be hurt if you didn't. I'd also love to see what people use this for, how they write about themselves, etc. so feel free to send me an email, tweet at me, or even hit me up on Facebook to show me!
